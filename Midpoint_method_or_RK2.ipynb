        "\n",
        "- The step size `h` determines how finely the interval is divided. Smaller step sizes typically yield more accurate results.\n",
        "- The loop ensures that the solution progresses iteratively from `x0` to `x1`.\n",
        "- The method improves accuracy by considering an additional slope calculation (`k2`) compared to simpler methods like Euler's method."
